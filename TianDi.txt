One player takes the role of of 天意.


Two or more others takes the role of 游侠, wanderers seeking a secret manuscript.


Deal 游侠 2 cards from a 52-card deck for character creation.


The first, your weapon.


Spade: Sword/Saber
Heart: Fist/Palm
Clubs: Staff/Spear
Diamond: Darts/Needles


Second, your tragedy:
Spade: Loss
Heart: Weakness
Clubs: Poison
Diamond: Amnesia


For each 游侠，天意 deals one card as encounters:
1-10: A citizen in need.
Jack: A corrupt politician or merchant seeks to end your life.
Queen: Someone connected to your past catches up to you.
King: The Emperor summons you for an unsavory task.


天意 and 游侠 tell the tale together until both are satisfied. 天意 decides whether to give 游侠 the card faceup, if they acted with compassion; or facedown, if they acted with vengeance.


Encounters continue until all 游侠 have five cards including weapon and past.


Manuscript phase:
Any facedown card may be changed out for a new card from the deck dealt facedown once. If 游侠 earns three facedown cards, they enter 走火入魔 state, and trade all five cards for a final hand of seven new facedown cards.


游侠 with the best 5-card poker hand finds the manuscript.

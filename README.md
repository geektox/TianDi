# TianDi

**TianDi** is a RPG project designed within the parameters of the [200 Word RPG Challenge](https://200wordrpg.github.io/). Based on the Wuxia genre, the inclusion of Chinese characters within the document is intentional. Players are welcome to seek out the meaning of the words on their own but no explanation will be given within the document iself.

Thanks for taking a look!
